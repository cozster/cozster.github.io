My name is Cozmin Ududec. I am Chief Scientist at [Invenia Labs](https://www.invenia.ca/labs/). 

The mission of Invenia Labs is optimize complex decision making in electricity grids, and improve economic efficiency and reduce emissions.  We participate daily in U.S. electricity markets through the mechanism of convergence bids. We use modern machine learning, data science and power system engineering to generate forecasts and decisions under uncertainty.

I hold a PhD in Physics from the University of Waterloo and Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. My focus was on reconstructing Quantum Theory from operational first principles. My curriculum vitae can be found [here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

I have broad interests in many areas of machine learning, quantum foundations and quantum information, philosophy of physics, economics, electricity grids, energy abundance, and the history of technology and innovation.
