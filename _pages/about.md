My name is Cozmin Ududec. At the moment I'm on sabbatical and exploring.

Most recently I was Chief Scientist at [Invenia Labs](https://www.invenia.ca/labs/), where I led a team of researchers with a mission to optimize complex decision making in electricity grids, and improve economic efficiency and reduce emissions.  

I hold a PhD in Physics from the University of Waterloo and Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. My focus was on reconstructing Quantum Theory from operational first principles. My curriculum vitae can be found [here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

I'm generally interested in machine learning, AI interpretability and safety, the [foundations of quantum theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.08410.pdf), economics, electricity grids, [energy superabundance](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/making-energy-too-cheap-to-meter), and the history of technology and innovation.
