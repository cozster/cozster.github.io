My name is Cozmin Ududec. At the moment I'm on a kind of sabbatical, and exploring various sorts of sci-fi shenanigans.

Most recently I was Chief Scientist at [Invenia Labs](https://www.invenia.ca/labs/), where I led a team of 25 researchers with a mission to optimize decision making in electricity grids, and improve economic efficiency and reduce emissions.  

I have a PhD in Physics from the University of Waterloo and [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/). My focus was on reconstructing Quantum Theory from [first principles](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/16/12/123029/pdf), so we can all stop worrying about the reality of the wave-function. My curriculum vitae can be found [here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

I'm generally interested in machine learning, AI interpretability and safety, the [foundations of quantum theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.08410.pdf), economics, electricity grids, [energy superabundance](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/making-energy-too-cheap-to-meter), and the history of technology and innovation.
